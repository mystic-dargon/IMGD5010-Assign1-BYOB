# Feedback from Maevan

Chose to try challenge #2 (Creating the T1C-TAC-T0E command prompt for a given set of moves)

Successfully wrote out the correct string of commands :)

# Feedback from Adryen

Completed all 3 challenges successfully.

From Adryen: "I really appreciate how simple and clear this was. My only feedback is that having a more complete starting key would really help someone like me who is very visual."
